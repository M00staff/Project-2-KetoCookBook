# Technologies, approach, instructions, unsolved problems

I used vanilla everything - i did toy with Bootstrap and CanCan a few days in, but they didn't merge well with everything i had already done, so i reset the commit and went back to vanilla.  I was a little upset with not getting Bootstrap to work since i really want to learn Sass/Less, but i figure getting more practice with vanilla CSS might be more beneficial at this stage of my development (and i did get a *little* more comfy with CSS)

My approach was pretty straight-forward, i wanted to make something simple that worked - and was hoping that i could finish early so i could use that extra time to refresh my JS and CSS skills.  I didn't get to do any JavaScript but i did get to spend a lot of time with CSS and am really glad i did (its kind of like riding a bike, i guess).  I took everything one at a time and managed my time quite well (which i think i am most proud of) i did not really get too stressed - which i am most happy about. I was really actually starting to enjoy rails towards the end there - mostly cause the error messages are so money.

unsolved problems - only real issue is that while you can delete posts and edit comments - you cannot delete comments or edit posts. Also some kind of admin feature to delete and edit would be nice (i showed it to a few friends and already got a spammy post that also tried to dump my database lol)
