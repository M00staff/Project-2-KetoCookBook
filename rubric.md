## Project Workflow
Wireframes and ERD's look great. I really enjoyed reading your readme.md file. Great work for project workflow. Exceeds Expectations.

## Technical Requirements
# Your project has 3 models with 2 associations. Its missing a couple of RESTful routes, but beyond that everything looks pretty good. Meets Expectations

## Creativity / Interface
I really like this idea. I love that you handrolled your CSS and the Interface is pretty seemless. I would try making it so i could comment right on the show page of the post instead of redirecting to a new view to just create a comment. Looks great though. Meets expectations.

## Code Quality
Theres a couple of indentation issues here and there. But the glaring thing that I've noticed is a lack of commenting. Future you will be much happier with past you if you comment your code effectively. Meets Expectations

## Deployment and Functionality
HAH, what a great recipe. I definitely laughed out loud when I read that post /w comments. Proof that it was deployed to the internet, already trolled. Website is deployed and functionality is solid(albeit missing a little CRUD).

## Overall
Really great job. I loved your comments in your readme. That you picked something solid that you could make happen. Set reasonable goals for yourself and achieved them. That's awesome. I encourage you for the next project to take that same attitude but additionally have goals that will extend your reach a bit as well. Solid work.
